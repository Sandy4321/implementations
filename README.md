how ML works!?

Let me show you how basic ML models work.
This repository shows how we can use just numpy to implement logistic regression, SVM and k-Nearest neighbor clustering.

For logistic regression and svm, the data set is health.csv.  This consists of blood measurements (columns 1 and 2) and health status (column 3, 1=heart disease present, -1=not present). 
For clustering, we have data.txt, which contains two arrays of numbers.
